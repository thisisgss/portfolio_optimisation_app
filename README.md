# üèÜ Portfolio Optimizer Pro

## Overview

The **Portfolio Optimizer Pro** is a comprehensive financial web application built on **Streamlit** that utilizes the principles of **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)**, primarily the **Markowitz Efficient Frontier**, to help users find the optimal allocation of assets. It is designed to be an all-in-one tool for analysis, personalization, and investment planning.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  * **Efficient Frontier & Optimization:**
      * Performs **Monte Carlo simulations** (for unconstrained portfolios) or **SLSQP Constrained Optimization** (for custom min/max weight rules) to identify the portfolio with the **Maximum Sharpe Ratio** and the **Minimum Volatility**.
  * **Personalized Allocation:**
      * A built-in risk assessment questionnaire determines the user's **risk profile** (Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive).
      * It then adjusts the optimal risky portfolio's weights by allocating capital between the optimal assets and a **risk-free asset** (cash/bonds) based on the user's risk tolerance.
  * **Investment Plan Generation:**
      * Generates a precise, real-world **Investment Breakdown** showing the exact **Amount to Invest** and the **Number of Shares** to purchase for each asset, based on a user-defined total investment amount and the latest market prices.
      * Handles currency conversion automatically for USD and INR stocks.
  * **Historical Backtesting:**
      * Compares your personalized portfolio's cumulative growth against a major market **benchmark** (e.g., ^NSEI for NIFTY 50) over the entire historical data range.
  * **Global Data Support:** Fetches real-time and historical stock data from Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`) for both US and Indian markets (NSE/BSE).
